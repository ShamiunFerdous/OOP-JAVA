An interface in Java is a blueprint for a class that defines a set of methods that a class must implement.
Unlike abstract classes, interfaces do not have instance variables or method implementations.

Constructor	is not allowed.
Methods are public by default.

From Java 8+, default and static methods with implementations are allowed.
