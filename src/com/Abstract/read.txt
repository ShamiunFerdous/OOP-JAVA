An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated (you can't create an object from it).
It is meant to be a base class for other classes.
Can contain both abstract and concrete methods.

An abstract method is a method that is declared but has no implementation in the abstract class.
The child classes must provide an implementation for the abstract methods.
