Inheritance is an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concept that allows a child class (subclass) to inherit
properties and methods from a parent class (superclass). This promotes code reusability and hierarchy.

Single Inheritance;
------------------------
A subclass inherits from a single parent class.

Multilevel Inheritance
------------------------
A class is inherited by another class, which is then inherited by another class.

class Animal {
    void eat() {
        System.out.println("Eating...");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    void bark() {
        System.out.println("Barking...");
    }
}

// Child of Dog class
class Puppy extends Dog {
    void weep() {
        System.out.println("Weeping...");
    }
}


Multiple Inheritance:
---------------------------
Java does not support multiple inheritance (one class inheriting from multiple classes) to avoid
the diamond problem. However, this can be achieved using interfaces.
